# Kubeadm Join Command Example
# This is a template file. The real join command is generated during cluster initialization.

# To get the actual join command, run on the control plane node:
# vagrant ssh fk-control -c "sudo kubeadm token create --print-join-command"

# The command will look like:
# kubeadm join <CONTROL_PLANE_IP>:6443 \
#   --token <TOKEN> \
#   --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<HASH>

# Example (DO NOT USE - this is not a real token):
# kubeadm join 192.168.56.10:6443 --token abcdef.0123456789abcdef --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef

# Security Notes:
# 1. Tokens are valid for 24 hours by default
# 2. After 24h, regenerate with: sudo kubeadm token create --print-join-command
# 3. NEVER commit the real join-command.sh to Git
# 4. The real file is automatically created by vagrant/03-control-plane-init.sh
# 5. The real file is ignored by .gitignore
